Same game as previously,
but players are http clients.
There is a server with the game, user names are known in advance.

For simplification, user name goes as an argument of GET request.
After the request user waits until the game is over and response contains game results.
Game is over when all 3 users have sended requests.
All users have 60 sec (default timeout) to make their turn since the first post.

Note. Resource racing issue can be ignored for now
